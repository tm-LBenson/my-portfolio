# Asking the Right Questions: Insights from a Recruiter Event

## Introduction

As job seekers, we often find ourselves wondering how to navigate the job market and make a strong impression on recruiters. It can be intimidating to approach recruiters and ask for opportunities, but building connections and networking is a crucial step in finding our dream job. Recently, I had the opportunity to attend an event called "Ask a Recruiter Anything" where three experienced recruiters shared their insights and advice on how to succeed in the job search process. In this blog post, I'll be sharing some of the key takeaways from the event, including tips on how to follow up with recruiters, make a strong impression in an interview, and stand out as a candidate. Whether you're just starting out in your career or looking to make a change, these insights can help guide you on your path to success.

## Developing a Winning Strategy

Finding the right job can be intimidating, but with a clear strategy in place, you can increase your chances of success. Kristen Fife, a recruiter at the "Ask a Recruiter Anything" event, emphasized the importance of understanding what recruiters are looking for in a candidate. One key aspect is having a strong set of functional skills - these are the tools and techniques that enable you to do your job effectively. Make a list of your functional skills and target employers that are looking for these skills to improve your chances of getting hired.

In addition to functional skills, it's also crucial to showcase any projects or accomplishments that demonstrate your expertise. Recruiters love to see candidates who have a track record of success, so don't be shy about sharing your achievements. If you have built something that has had a measurable impact or is being used by a large number of people, be sure to include that information on your resume and in your job search materials.

Networking is another essential part of finding the right job. Building relationships with hiring managers and recruiters can give you a competitive edge and help you learn about opportunities that may not be widely advertised. By engaging with others in your field and showcasing your knowledge and expertise through content creation, you can establish yourself as a thought leader and increase your visibility to potential employers.

## Tailoring Your Resume to the Job

At the "Ask a Recruiter Anything" event, it was emphasized how important it is to tailor your resume to the job you are applying for. To do this effectively, it's crucial to understand what recruiters are looking for and highlight the skills and experiences that align with the job description.

Before you apply for a job, take the time to carefully review the job description and identify the skills and responsibilities required for the role. Then, make sure that your resume showcases these skills and experiences prominently. This will help you stand out as a candidate and increase your chances of getting an interview.

Including quantitative data on your resume can be a powerful way to showcase your skills and experiences. This data can help recruiters understand the tangible impact you have had in your previous roles and make you a more competitive candidate. Some examples of quantitative data that you could include on your resume include the number of people you supervised, the number of web applications you built in a year for a company, or the amount of money you saved for a company through a project you worked on. If you don't have specific quantitative data to share, you can always use data that is publicly available about the company you worked for, such as data from press releases or company reports. Another approach is to share data about your daily work, such as the number of calls you handled or tickets you closed out on a help desk. Whatever data you choose to include, be sure to highlight the most relevant and impactful numbers to help recruiters understand your skills and value as a candidate.

Remember, recruiters are looking for candidates who have a strong set of functional skills, or the tools and techniques that enable them to do their job effectively. Be sure to highlight your functional skills on your resume and showcase any projects or experiences where you have used these skills in a practical setting.

By tailoring your resume to the job and including quantitative data, you can make a strong impression on recruiters and increase your chances of securing the opportunity to interview for your dream job.

## Following up with recruiters

Following up with recruiters after submitting an application or after a job interview can be a crucial step in the job search process. But it's important to do it in a way that is professional and respectful of the recruiter's time.

One key piece of advice from the "Ask a Recruiter Anything" event was to make sure you have the recruiter's email or contact information before reaching out. You can often find this information on their LinkedIn profile or on the company website. It's also a good idea to research the recruiter's role and make sure they are responsible for hiring for the position you are interested in.

When you do follow up, be concise and to the point. Consider thanking the recruiter for their time and reiterating your interest in the position. If you have new information or updates to share, such as a new accomplishment or skill, feel free to mention it briefly.

It's also a good idea to be open to feedback and ask if there is anything else the recruiter would like to know about you or your qualifications. This can help to demonstrate your professionalism and willingness to learn.

Overall, following up with recruiters can help to keep you top of mind and increase your chances of getting an interview or job offer. Just be sure to do it in a way that is respectful and professional.

## Gaining experience in a new field

When it comes to transitioning into a new field, it can be challenging to gain the necessary experience to qualify for roles you're interested in. However, there are several strategies you can use to gain valuable experience and make yourself a more competitive candidate.

One option is to take on stretch assignments or side projects within your current company that allow you to gain exposure to the skills and responsibilities you're interested in. This can be a great way to build your portfolio and demonstrate your ability to learn and adapt.

Another option is to seek out internships or entry-level positions in the field you're interested in. These roles may not pay as well as more experienced positions, but they can provide valuable experience and help you build your network.

Finally, consider volunteering or working on projects for non-profits or community organizations. This can be a great way to gain hands-on experience and make a difference in your community at the same time.

By using a combination of these strategies, you can gain the experience you need to transition into a new field and increase your chances of finding your dream job.

## Making a strong impression in an interview

When it comes to interviews, it's important to make a strong impression and stand out as a candidate. There are several ways you can do this:

- Research the company beforehand and come prepared with thoughtful questions
- Practice common interview questions with a friend or mentor
- Be enthusiastic and show your passion for the role and the industry
- Dress appropriately and be punctual
- Highlight your skills and accomplishments, and give concrete examples of how you have applied them in previous roles
- Be honest and transparent about your strengths and weaknesses, and be prepared to talk about how you are working on improving any areas of development

Another way to stand out in an interview is by showcasing your problem-solving skills. This could involve discussing a time when you faced a challenge at work and describing the steps you took to overcome it. You could also talk about a time when you had to troubleshoot an issue or come up with a creative solution to a problem. By highlighting your ability to think on your feet and find solutions to challenges, you can demonstrate your value to the company and make a strong impression in the interview. Additionally, it's important to research the company and industry beforehand and come prepared with specific questions about the role and the company culture. This shows that you are truly interested in the position and the company, and it gives you an opportunity to learn more about the company and how you might fit in.

It's also important to remember to listen to the interviewer's questions and answer thoughtfully. Show that you have a clear understanding of the role and the company's needs, and be prepared to share your ideas and insights. By making a strong impression in an interview, you increase your chances of getting hired and taking the next step in your career.

## Handling rejection

When it comes to the job search process, rejection is an unfortunately common experience. While it can be disheartening, it's important to remember that rejection is often just a part of the process and does not define your worth as a candidate.

One way to handle rejection is to ask for feedback. This can help you understand what you can improve upon in your job search and give you a chance to grow and develop as a candidate. It's also important to stay positive and not let rejection discourage you from continuing your job search. Keep in mind that the right opportunity may be just around the corner and that every rejection is simply a step closer to finding your dream job.

Another helpful strategy for dealing with rejection is to build a support system. Surrounding yourself with friends and loved ones who can offer encouragement and help you stay motivated can make a big difference in how you handle rejection. It's also helpful to seek out mentors or career advisors who can offer guidance and support as you navigate the job market.

Finally, don't be afraid to take some time to regroup and recharge. It can be tough to keep up the job search, especially if you are facing a lot of rejection. Taking a break to focus on your own well-being can help you come back to the job search feeling refreshed and re-energized.

## Uncovering Hidden Career Opportunities

Did you know that only about 5% of all jobs are filled through applications alone? This means that having a strong professional network and connections can greatly increase your chances of landing your dream job. One effective way to build these connections is by reaching out to companies that you are interested in working for, even if they don't have any current job openings.

As Chris Bloomquist mentioned during the "Ask a Recruiter Anything" webinar, one approach is to research the company and find something specific that interests you, then reach out to someone in the department you are interested in working in. When you make contact, be sure to emphasize that you are not looking for a job, but rather just want to learn more about the company and its culture. This can be a great opportunity to make a good impression and show your unique interest in the company.

During this conversation, have some questions prepared that will help you learn more about the company and its values. This could include asking about what motivates the employees, what the company looks for in new hires, and what the company culture is like. By showing genuine interest and asking thoughtful questions, you can make a strong connection with the company and increase your chances of being considered for future job openings.

Remember, building relationships and making connections is key to uncovering hidden career opportunities. Be yourself and ask good, genuine questions to build trust and show your unique value to the company. Even if there aren't any current job openings, making a connection now can lead to future opportunities down the line.

## Being Intentional and Responsive as a Job Seeker

When searching for a job that works for you, it's important to consider factors such as the schedule, pay, and benefits offered by the company. Additionally, it's important to be on the lookout for red flags that may indicate a toxic or unhealthy work environment. These red flags might include a high employee turnover rate, negative reviews or complaints from current or former employees, or a lack of transparency or open communication from management. By paying attention to these factors and being selective in your job search, you can increase your chances of finding a job that is a good fit for you and that you will be happy in.

During the "Ask a Recruiter Anything" webinar, Matt Quarterman, a recruiter, recommended using [Strengthsfinder](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/254033/strengthsfinder.aspx) as a tool to identify your strengths and find a job that aligns with them. This tool can help you understand what you are naturally good at and guide you in finding a role that fits your strengths and interests. While there is a cost to using Strengthsfinder, investing in yourself and your career can pay off in the long run and help you find a job that truly "works for you".

Another key aspect of finding the right job is being proactive and intentional in your search. Don't just randomly apply for jobs; put effort into finding positions that align with your goals and experience. Additionally, don't just take any course or training just for the sake of it; make sure it will be beneficial and add value to your skill set.

Your resume is an important tool in the job search process, but its main purpose is to get you an interview, not to land the job itself. To increase your chances of getting an interview, be sure to tailor your resume to the specific job you are applying for and highlight the skills and experiences that align with the job description. Doing research on the company and including relevant data and metrics can also help you stand out as a candidate.

During the interview process, it can be helpful to use the STAR method to structure your responses to behavioral questions. The STAR method involves describing a specific Situation or Task, the Action you took, and the Results of your action. This helps you provide clear and concise responses that demonstrate your skills and experiences.

As you navigate the job search process, it's important to remember that not every job you interview for will be a good fit. It's okay to be rejected, and it's important to keep an open mind and continue to explore other opportunities. As Chris Bloomquist said at the end of the "Ask a Recruiter Anything" event, "Remember, if you got an interview (and not the job) that is PROGRESS, because many others didn't get the interview in the first place. That means you're close to landing something great!"
