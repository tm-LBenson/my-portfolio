# Learning to Code My First Week at Code Fellows

Welcome to my blog! In this post, I'll be sharing my experience during my first week at Code Fellows, a coding bootcamp in Seattle that I took remotely. Before starting at Code Fellows, I had already been learning to code on my own through an online course on Udemy. I went through a full stack course and even completed a capstone project - a full stack app using technologies such as express, ejs, and mongodb. However, I had no experience with collaboration and wanted to learn more about working with other developers in a team setting.

When I returned home from deployment in the Middle East, I discovered that I had access to amazing veteran benefits that would allow me to attend a coding bootcamp with no financial burden. Although the course would take a significant amount of time, and I wouldn't be able to work during that time, I decided that the accelerated learning experience would be the best way for me to get into the tech industry as quickly as possible.

So, here I am - ready to start my journey at Code Fellows and see what the next few months have in store for me. Grab a cup of coffee and join me as I share my experiences and the lessons I learn along the way.

## Continuing My Coding Journey: Testing into Code 201

Before starting the full-time course at Code Fellows, I had to take a placement test to determine which level of the program I was ready for. I was a little nervous about the test, as I wasn't sure how well my self-taught skills would compare to those of my peers who had completed more formal coding education. However, I was determined to do my best and was hopeful that I would be placed in the basic class, Code 201.

The test required that I had completed the pre-work for setting up my machine prior to taking the test, which wasn't very clear in the instructions. Fortunately, I had already done the pre-work while waiting on my VA benefits, so I was able to take the test without any issues. A few of the questions were related to messages received in the terminal during the setup process, which was a helpful way to ensure that I had completed all of the necessary steps.

I was happy to report that I scored 100% on the placement test, which was a great confidence boost and a reassuring indication that I was ready to move on to the next level of my coding journey. With my placement test successfully behind me, I was excited to begin my journey into the basic software development course at Code Fellows. I couldn't wait to see what the next few months had in store for me and to start building on the skills I had already learned.

## Feeling Right at Home: My First Week at Code Fellows

During my first week at Code Fellows, I participated in a full-time basic software development course and kept a learning journal for each day. On the first day, I had the opportunity to meet my classmates and instructors and complete some administrative tasks to get settled in. The second day was filled with learning, as we reviewed the HTML assignment that asks a user four questions using prompts and also covered data types, including comparison operators and the difference between "falsey" values and data types. We also learned about the workflow of Git and GitHub and created a repo that we cloned to our local machines. On the third day, we started by reviewing the upcoming assignments so that we could prepare ourselves and also learned about arrays and loops. The fourth day was packed with learning as well, as we covered problem-solving, CSS positioning, functions, and Git forking and pull requests. Finally, on the fifth day, we focused on problem-solving strategies, image types and compatibility, CSS styling and responsive design, and Git branching. Overall, it was a productive and educational week, and I learned a lot of new concepts and skills that will be valuable as I continue my coding journey.

## Reflections on Week 1

After my first week at Code Fellows, I felt confident that I had made the right choice in enrolling in this program. The course was intense and covered a lot of material, but I was able to keep up and absorb a lot of new information. I was really looking forward to starting week 2 and continuing my learning journey. One thing to note is that the course did require a significant time commitment. I was given homework over the weekend and my schedule for the week was from noon to 9pm, which would have been very difficult for someone trying to work and learn at the same time unless they enrolled in the nights and weekends plan. However, for me, the full-time course was the best option because I was able to focus on my studies without any distractions.

I'm looking forward to sharing more of my experiences at Code Fellows in the coming weeks, so be sure to check back next week for the follow-up to this post. Thanks for reading!
