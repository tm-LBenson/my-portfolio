# Title: My Second Week at Code Fellows: Object-Oriented Programming and More

## Introduction

Welcome back to my ongoing series about my experiences at Code Fellows, a coding bootcamp in Seattle that I took remotely. In this post, I'll be sharing my experiences during my second week at the bootcamp, where we focused on object-oriented programming and continued to build upon the concepts and skills we learned during the first week. It was a busy and productive week, and I had the opportunity to learn many new things and continue improving my coding skills. In this post, I'll be sharing some of the highlights of my week and the lessons I learned along the way. So, join me as I continue to document my journey through the Code Fellows program.

## Career Development at Code Fellows

One of the things that I appreciated about Code Fellows is their focus on career development. In addition to learning technical skills, the program provides opportunities for students to work on their professional development and increase their competitiveness in the job market.

During my second week at the bootcamp, we worked on career assignments and had the opportunity to learn more about the tech industry and how to position ourselves as competitive candidates. This included writing interview questions in the star format, attending virtual meetups, and working with accountability partners to review our resumes and professional portfolios.

These career development activities were very valuable, as they helped me to think more critically about my career goals and what I need to do to achieve them. It was also helpful to have my accountability partner's support and my instructors' guidance as I worked on these assignments.

Overall, Code Fellows strongly emphasizes career development and is committed to helping its students succeed in their careers. I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in these activities and believe they will benefit me as I continue my journey in the tech industry.

## An Overview of What I Learned in Week 2

I focused on various topics and skills during my second week at Code Fellows. Some of the highlights of the week included:

- Object-oriented programming: We covered principles such as object literals, methods, and constructor functions.

- Career development: We worked on career assignments and learned more about the tech industry and how to position ourselves as competitive candidates. This included things like writing interview questions in the star format, attending virtual meetups, and working with accountability partners to review our resumes and professional portfolios.

- Problem-solving: We focused on strategies for approaching coding challenges in a systematic and logical way.

- CSS and responsive design: We learned about CSS positioning and styling and how to create responsive designs that look good on different devices.

During my second week at Code Fellows, the topics of object-oriented programming, career development, problem-solving, and CSS and responsive design were relatively familiar or straightforward for me due to my prior experience with coding. While I appreciated the opportunity to review and reinforce these concepts, I was also looking for more challenging material to continue learning and growing as a developer.

Collaboration and pair programming, as well as using Git, were more valuable topics for me, as I had not had much opportunity to work with others or use these tools in my previous studies. In addition, working with a team and using version control were critical skills in a professional development setting, and I was particularly interested in learning more about these topics.

## Building My Skills with Code 201

Although I was placed in the basic software development course (Code 201) after taking the placement test, I found that the material covered during my second week was still very basic for me. This was partly because I had already completed a full stack course on Udemy, taught by Colt Steele, before starting at Code Fellows.

However, I didn't let this discourage me and instead focused on the opportunity to learn new concepts and techniques, as well as to improve my coding skills. I also appreciated the chance to work on my problem-solving skills and to learn how to think more like a developer.

Overall, Code 201 provided a strong foundation for my coding journey, and the concepts and skills I learned during this week were valuable as I continued to build upon them in the future. Although some of the material may have been familiar to me, I still had a lot to learn and was excited to see what the next few weeks had in store.

## Reflections on Week 2

My second week at Code Fellows was a productive and educational experience that allowed me to continue building upon my coding skills. While some of the topics covered were familiar to me due to my prior experience, I was also able to learn new things and challenge myself in areas such as collaboration, pair programming, and using Git. Overall, the course was a valuable and enriching experience that prepared me for a career in the tech industry. Thank you for following along on my journey and for reading my blog. I hope that my experiences and insights have been helpful and informative, and I look forward to sharing more of my journey with you in future posts. I will write about my third week at Code Fellows next week, so stay tuned for more updates on my coding journey.
